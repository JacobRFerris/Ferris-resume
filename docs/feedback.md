Jacob, 

Your resume looks great! Very clean looking. One thing I did notice is that throughout your bulleted points some had periods at the end, while others didn't. I would recommend making that consistent. If you have any projects to add, I think that could be a great thing to add as well. Besides that, I thought your resume looked good.

Long live Bob
